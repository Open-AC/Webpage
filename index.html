                Welcome to OpenAC, where we take Roblox® anti-cheat seriously... but not too seriously. Led by the unstoppable duo, Liker and Unlimited, we're here to save your experiences from exploiters, one cheat at a time.
                We made the average game developer's treasure, like resources that cover advanced yet easy to prevent cheats, and solutions used in several experiences.
                Whether you're a seasoned developer or just trying to keep your game free from hackers, we've got your back!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our journey began with the creation of legendary anti-cheat tools like ASTON, Karma, LAT-AT, and Polygon AE — tools that have long since hung up their hats but still live on in the hearts (and code) of developers.
                All this was before Roblox® partnered with Byfron Technologies in 2022, proving that we've been ahead of the curve in this battle.
                We mix a little humor with our expertise, because who said keeping cheaters out can't be fun?
            </p>
            <h1 class="big-recap-label">
                With your help, let's make Roblox® fair — and have a few laughs along the way!

                            Hi, I'm Liker, the founder of OpenAC and someone who's all about creating smarter, more resilient yet lightweight anti-cheat systems.
                            Since diving into cybersecurity at a young age, I've been driven to make online environments safer—especially on Roblox, where I work on innovative anti-exploit techniques and help developers stay one step ahead of exploiters.

                            Over the years, I've gained recognition in the developer community for my detailed posts and effective anti-cheat techniques, aimed at protecting games from various vulnerabilities and exploit attempts.

                We're not just building tools — we're making a real difference in the Roblox community by giving developers the power to detect exploiters and keep their games safe.
                From industry veterans to new developers, people rely on our anti-cheat solutions daily to stay ahead of game-breaking exploits.
                Our methods are tested, battle-proven, and — if we're being honest — kind of fun to watch in action.
                Every 45 seconds, this counter will update to an approximated total amount of exploiters since OpenAC was firstly implemented.
